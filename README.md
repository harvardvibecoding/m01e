This project contains the instructor's solution to the previous unit, where we vibe-coded a Python program (`trends_save.py`) that saves the data scraped from Google Trends by the routines in `trends_scraper.py`. The learner's task in this project is to vibe-code a Python program (`trends_plot.py`) that reads the CSV file produced by `trends_save.py` and produces a plot in `interest_data.png`.

```bash
python3 trends_save.py
```

This command produces `scraped_data.csv`, which is read by the next command.

```bash
python3 trends_plot.py
```

This command produces `interest_data.png`.
